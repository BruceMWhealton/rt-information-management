# Information Management Application
This is an application using Firebase - a Real-time key-value store with a 
RESTful interface.  In addition to Firebase, this application makes use of
AngularJS an MVC (sometimes Angular is called MVVM, other times MVWhatever) 
JavaScript framework.  

This application keeps track of your
contacts (name, company, address, notes, etc.).  In addition, each user can
keep track of goals and various sub-tasks related to reaching a particular 
goal.  This might be something similar to what people do around New Years when
they make New Year's Resolutions.  Thirdly, this application will manage 
projects.  For example, I have a web development company.  An important way to 
keep up with various clients, various projects and etc. is to have a tool to 
manage all this.  

#**NOTE:** These Goals and Projects examples just listed above, are just that
Examples.  This app lets you use the features to meet your needs.  You are not 
forced to use both Goals and Projects, or to separate them out.  

## Extra features or improvements will come about based on user feedback.

Additional features to add would be a live chat application from an HTML5 web page, which will be integrated
into the site with routing and a menu item across the top.
